### Antique Society <br>

Built in 48 hours, a technical challenge to precisely match a designer's Photoshop files, to create a dynamic HTML/CSS one page site with transition animations, a parallax effect and a collapsing menu. 

The client wanted a few extra elements: 

Portrait vs landscape orientation changes in CSS behaviour
Collapsing burger menu bar
Font size alterations according to screen size (without using vw)
Menu transition animations
Parallax effect on the jumbotron / hero
Precise font matching and letter spacing matching
